# Book Management Application (Backend)

This project is the backend for the Book Management Application. It is built using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **TypeScript**. The backend exposes a REST API for managing books and interacts with a **SQLite** database.

## General Guidelines

The backend allows the following operations:

- **Add a book**: Users can add a new book with details like title, author, and ISBN.
- **List all books**: Users can fetch all books stored in the database.
- **Filter books**: Users can filter books by title, author, or ISBN.
- **Edit a book**: Users can update an existing bookâ€™s details.
- **Delete a book**: Users can delete a book from the database.

### Technologies Used:
- **Node.js** (Server-side JavaScript runtime)
- **Express** (Web framework)
- **TypeScript** (For static typing and development)
- **SQLite** (Database to store books)
